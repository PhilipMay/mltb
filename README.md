# Machine Learning Tool Box
This is the machine learning tool box. A collection of userful machine learning tools intended for reuse and extension.

The toolbox contains the following modules:
* keras - callbacks for metrics and tools
* lightgbm - metric tools
* metrics - several metrics 
* plot - plot and visualisation tools
* tools - various statistical tools

## Module lightgbm
This module implements metric functions that are not included in LightGBM. 
At the moment this is the F1- and accuracy-score for binary and multi class problems.
